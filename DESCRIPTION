Description: Supporting the quantitative analysis of binary welfare based 
    decision making processes using Monte Carlo simulations. Decision support 
    is given on two levels: (i) The actual decision level is to choose between 
    two alternatives under probabilistic uncertainty. This package calculates 
    the optimal decision based on maximizing expected welfare. (ii) The meta 
    decision level is to allocate resources to reduce the uncertainty in the 
    underlying decision problem, i.e to increase the current information to 
    improve the actual decision making process. This problem is dealt with 
    using the Value of Information Analysis (VIA). The Expected Value of 
    Information (EVI) for arbitrary prospective estimates can be calculated as 
    well as Individual and Clustered Expected Value of Perfect Information 
    (EVPI). The probabilistic calculations are done via Monte Carlo 
    simulations. This Monte Carlo functionality can be used on its own.
