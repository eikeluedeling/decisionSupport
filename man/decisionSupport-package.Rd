\title{Quantitative Support of Decision Making under Uncertainty.}
\description{
The \pkg{\code{decisionSupport}} package supports the quantitative analysis of
welfare based decision making processes using Monte Carlo simulations. This
is an important part of the Applied Information Economics (AIE) approach
developed in Hubbard (2014). These decision making processes can be
categorized into two levels of decision making:
\enumerate{
	\item The actual problem of interest of a policy maker
	which we call the \emph{underlying welfare based decision} on how to influence an
	ecological-economic system based on a particular information on the system
	available to the decision maker and
	\item the \emph{meta decision} on how to allocate resources to reduce the
	uncertainty in the underlying decision problem, i.e to increase the current
	information to improve the underlying decision making process.
}
The first problem, i.e. the underlying problem, is the problem of choosing
the decision which maximizes expected welfare. The welfare function can be
interpreted as a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. Whereas, the
second problem, i.e. the meta decision problem, is dealt with using the
\emph{Value of Information Analysis (VIA)}. Value of Information Analysis
seeks to assign a value to a certain reduction in uncertainty or,
equivalently, increase in information. Uncertainty is dealt with in a
probabilistic manner. Probabilities are transformed via Monte Carlo
simulations.
}
\details{
The functionality of this package is subdivided into three main parts: (i) the
welfare based analysis of the underlying decision, (ii) the meta decision of
reducing uncertainty and (iii) the Monte Carlo simulation for the
transformation of probabilities and calculation of expectation values. Furthermore,
there is a wrapper function around these three parts which aims at providing an
easy-to-use interface.
\subsection{Welfare based Analysis of the Underlying Decision Problem}{
				Implementation: \code{\link{welfareDecisionAnalysis}}
		}
\subsection{The Meta Decision of Reducing Uncertainty}{
		The meta decision of how to allocate resources for uncertainty reduction can
		be analyzed with this package in two different ways: via (i) Expected Value
		of Information Analysis or (ii) via Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis and
		Variable Importance in Projection (VIP).
		\subsection{Expected Value of Information (EVI)}{
				Implementation: \code{\link{eviSimulation}}, \code{\link{individualEvpiSimulation}}

		\subsection{Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis and Variable Importance in Projection (VIP)}{
				Implementation: \code{\link{plsr.mcSimulation}}, \code{\link[chillR:VIP]{VIP}}
		}

\subsection{Solving the Practical Problem of Calculating Expectation Values by Monte Carlo Simulation}{
		\subsection{Estimates}{
			Implementation: \code{\link{estimate}}

		\subsection{Multivariate Random Number Generation}{
			Implementation: \code{\link{random.estimate}}

\subsection{Integrated Welfare Decision and Value of Information Analysis: A wrapper function}{
	The function \code{\link{decisionSupport}} integrates the most important features of this
	package into a single function. It is wrapped arround the functions
	\code{\link{welfareDecisionAnalysis}}, \code{\link{plsr.mcSimulation}},
	\code{\link[chillR:VIP]{VIP}} and \code{\link{individualEvpiSimulation}}.
